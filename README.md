### Documenting a simple FPS game

This repository contains a little website made with **React.js** that aims to explain all the various steps perfomed during the development of **'Low Poly Robots Attack!'**, a simple game created with **three.js**. 

You can visit the website [here](https://sergiopicca.github.io/lowPolyRobotsAttack/) and understand our motivation, the game logic and hopefully enjoy our work!
